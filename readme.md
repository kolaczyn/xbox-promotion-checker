# TypeScript starter template

## About

I created the repo, because I got tired of writing writing the same code every few months I had a cool idea.

## Batteries included

- TypeScript setup (with ts-node)
- Prettier config
- eslint config
- Jest
  - with TS support
- VS Code setup
  - devcontainers
  - debugger
- GitHub actions
  - run lint, tests, and others for PRs and main push
- case be used as a base of a package

## Additional Info

- Supports Node.js v18 and up.
- If you don't intend to use it as a base of package, you should remove scripts from `package.json` that begin with `build:*`

## TODO

- add path aliases
- preconfigure for making packages
